# Bamazon

Bamazon is your personal shopping center built into a convenient, easy-to-use command line node application!

Upon running the app, you will be sent to the Main Menu, where you can start shopping, view your cart, or exit the app!

If you select Start Shopping, you get to choose between viewing all items, viewing Bamazon's different departments, or viewing your cart. 

Adding an item to your cart is easy! Once you've navigated to a product list either by viewing all, or by choosing one of our many categories, just hit enter on the item you want, then tell Bamazon how many of that item you want in your cart. Bamazon will let you know the items have been added, then you can keep shopping or view your cart!

From the shopping cart you can edit items, keep shopping, or check out. You can update how many items you want or remove items from the edit selection. If there's enough of everything in stock, your order will be placed! You will recieve a confirmation messagee and return to the main menu. If there isn't enough of a product you  order in stock, you will be notified of the insufficient amount and that item will not be ordered, although all other items in your order WILL be ordered and you will still recieve confirmation.
